## How the 80/20 Filtering Works

The app applies the Pareto Principle to filter meeting content:

**80% Signal (What's Kept):**
- Key decisions made
- Important action items with owners and deadlines
- Critical discussions and conclusions
- Strategic insights
- Problem statements and solutions

**20% Noise (What's Filtered Out):**
- Small talk and pleasantries
- Repetitive statements
- Off-topic discussions
- Filler words
- Tangential comments

## Technology Stack

- **Frontend**: HTML5, CSS3, JavaScript (Vanilla)
- **Backend**: Node.js, Express
- **AI**: Google Gemini 2.5 Flash
- **Audio**: Web Audio API, MediaRecorder API
