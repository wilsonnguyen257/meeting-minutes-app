## How the 80/20 Filtering Works

The app applies the Pareto Principle to filter meeting content:

**80% Signal (What's Kept):**
- Key decisions made
- Important action items with owners and deadlines
- Critical discussions and conclusions
- Strategic insights
- Problem statements and solutions

**20% Noise (What's Filtered Out):**
- Small talk and pleasantries
- Repetitive statements
- Off-topic discussions
- Filler words
- Tangential comments

## Technology Stack

- **Frontend**: HTML5, CSS3, JavaScript (Vanilla)
- **Backend**: Node.js, Express
- **AI**: Google Gemini 2.5 Flash
- **Audio**: Web Audio API, MediaRecorder API

## Troubleshooting

### Very Long Recordings (>1 hour)
- Processing may take 5-10 minutes
- Ensure stable internet connection
- Don't close browser during processing
- If timeout occurs, try splitting into shorter segments

### Microphone Not Working
- Check browser permissions for microphone access
- Ensure you're using HTTPS or localhost
- Try a different browser (Chrome/Edge recommended)

### API Errors
- Verify your Gemini API key is correct in `.env`
- Check your API quota hasn't been exceeded
- Ensure you have internet connectivity

### Audio Processing Fails
- Check server logs for detailed error messages
- Verify the audio file was recorded properly
- Try recording a shorter clip first

## Browser Compatibility

- ✅ Chrome/Edge (Recommended)
- ✅ Firefox
- ⚠️ Safari (limited Web Audio API support)
